Formatting
----------

Formatting issues are the most contentious but the least consequential.
People can adapt to different formatting styles but it's better if they
don't have to, and less time is devoted to the topic if everyone adheres
to the same style. The problem is how to approach this Utopia without a
long prescriptive style guide.

With Go we take an unusual approach and let the machine take care of
most formatting issues. The `gofmt` program (also available as `go fmt`,
which operates at the package level rather than source file level) reads
a Go program and emits the source in a standard style of indentation and
vertical alignment, retaining and if necessary reformatting comments. If
you want to know how to handle some new layout situation, run `gofmt`;
if the answer doesn't seem right, rearrange your program (or file a bug
about `gofmt`), don't work around it.

As an example, there's no need to spend time lining up the comments on
the fields of a structure. `Gofmt` will do that for you. Given the
declaration

    type T struct {
        name string // name of the object
        value int // its value
    }

`gofmt` will line up the columns:

    type T struct {
        name    string // name of the object
        value   int    // its value
    }

All Go code in the standard packages has been formatted with `gofmt`.

Some formatting details remain. Very briefly:

Indentation
:   We use tabs for indentation and `gofmt` emits them by default. Use
    spaces only if you must.

Line length
:   Go has no line length limit. Don't worry about overflowing a punched
    card. If a line feels too long, wrap it and indent with an
    extra tab.

Parentheses

:   Go needs fewer parentheses than C and Java: control structures
    (`if`, `for`, `switch`) do not have parentheses in their syntax.
    Also, the operator precedence hierarchy is shorter and clearer, so

        x<<8 + y<<16

    means what the spacing implies, unlike in the other languages.
